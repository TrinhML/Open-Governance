## Proposed Topic

* Session Title: Using Apache NiFi to Integrate Data into a NoSQL Multi-Model Database
* Preferred Timeframe: October 24th
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: Apache NiFi was built to automate the flow of data, providing a drag and drop, configurable user interface. With Apache NiFi, you can use out-of-the-box processors to create data flows from MySQL, Postgres, Apache Kafka, the Hadoop ecosystem, and many other data sources. If a processor doesn’t exist, you can build your own. You can also create templates for common data flow patterns, then publish and share them for collaboration needs.

Scott Fowler, MarkLogic Principal Sales Engineer, will discuss the value of integrating unstructured and structured data from multiple sources into an Operational Data Hub. This presentation will include a demonstration using Apache NiFi to ingest data into a MarkLogic NoSQL database.

## Accepted Topics

### Lightening Talks
*Scheduled August 15th*
---

* Session Title: You've Been a Bad Programmer Now Goto Your Room!: Composing Batch Files
* Preferred Timeframe: August or Otherwise
* Event Type: Lightning Talk
* Summary: In many batch files in the wild, there is little or no structure, leading to hard-to-read and sometimes scary-to-run scripts. By imposing just a few simple rules, a batch file can be transformed into a wonderful jewel of a script that can be simple to read, write and maintain. If you need or like to spend time at the command line, you might find this useful.

* Session Title: Describing JSON data with JSON Schema
* Preferred Timeframe: 10-15 minutes
* Event Type: Lightning Talk
* Summary: When people are talking about RESTful APIs, they usually think of resources and associated HTTP methods. But for me, data is in the heart of almost every API. JSON Schema is a precise description of JSON data which is both machine-readable and human-friendly. In this presentation, I will talk about how JSON schema is used to describe the structure of JSON data and provide an overview of my favorite features. By the end of this talk, you will know how to describe objects and their properties. In addition to this, you will also know how to model data type inheritance in JSON Schema.

### Chicken Soup for the Automated Soul
*Scheduled August 29th* 

* Session Title: Chicken Soup for the Automated Soul: How small teams can iterate on launching code for big projects
* Preferred Timeframe: Sometime before September 15th
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: At NPR Digital Media we have chosen Jenkins CI as our in-house choice for launching code. While smaller projects lend themselves well to the Jenkins paradigm, large monolith repos do not. This talk is about how a small team of 30+ developers handle the stresses of launching something that millions depend on and our brand rests its laurels on. Focus will be on things we've tried, things we've failed at, and things we're still iterating.
